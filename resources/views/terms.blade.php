Among other things, Volt provides those home and business owners with opportunities to contact Third-Part Vendors including, but not limited to, distributed energy system manufacturers, distributed energy system installers (electricians, plumbers and other contractors), and financiers (banks and other lending institutions) in order to receive additional information from them, including project proposals, estimates for installation and other professional services, and project financing. (See “Submitted Requests,” in Section IV “Requests for Information and Services,” above.) Volt may, in turn, receive a fee or other compensation from these distributed energy system manufacturers, distributed energy system installers and financiers, for providing them with the opportunity to respond to Submitted Requests (“Opportunities”). Volt does not charge home or business owners a fee either to use the Site or any of the Services. Neither is Volt itself a distributed energy system manufacturer, a distributed energy system installer, a contractor, a distributor, or broker of energy-related products. Under no circumstance will Volt be liable in any way for services or products provided by third parties, including Third-Party Vendors, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of, or reliance upon, such products or services.</br></br>Volt is not authorized, and hereby specifically declines any such authority if offered, to act as an agent on behalf of any distributed energy system manufacturer, or any distributed energy system installer or other contractor, or financier, except for the purposes of generating Opportunities in the manner described in the previous paragraph.</br></br>Users may authorize Volt to provide them with consulting services, or to act as their agent on a fee-for-service basis. Users must provide any such authority expressly in writing, and in the absence of such a writing a User shall neither assume nor infer that Volt has agreed to provide consulting services, or to act as an agent on their behalf.</br></br>From time to time Volt does enter into partnerships with for-profit companies and firms, non-profit organizations, municipalities and other governmental entities, and employers (collectively “Channel Partners”), to offer their customers, clients, members, constituents, and employees the Services provided at the Site, as described in Section III, “Description of Services; Limitations on Services,” above.</br></br>Your dealings with organizations, firms, and/or individuals found on or through the Site or the Services, or with any Channel Partner with whom you are affiliated, including any payment(s) for the delivery of goods and/or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, whether or not you have authorized Volt in writing to serve as your agent on a fee-for-service basis, are solely between you and such organizations, firms, Channel Partners, and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate prior to engaging in any transaction, financial or otherwise, with any of these third parties, including Channel Partners and Third-Party Vendors, whether or not you engage in any transaction, financial or otherwise, with any of these third parties, including upon the suggestion of Volt after authorizing Volt in writing to provide you with consulting services or to act as your agent on your behalf on a fee for service basis.</br></br>You agree that Volt shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any kind that is incurred as the result of any such dealings with organizations, firms, Third-Party Vendors, and/or individuals found on or through the Site or the Services, or with any Channel Partner.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code 1542, which states: “[a] general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if know by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of a state other than California with a law similar to the law just cited, you hereby waive that similar law.</br>X. Conduct</br></br>You promise not to use the Site or any of its Services for any purpose that is unlawful, that is otherwise prohibited by these TOU, or that is not reasonably intended by Volt. Neither may you use the Site nor any of the Services in any manner that could interfere with another party\'s use and enjoyment of the Site, or any of the Services.</br></br>You agree not to post, email, or otherwise make available Content:</br></br>1.     that is abusive, or intended to harass or threaten, intimidate or impersonate other Users;</br></br>2.     that is libelous or defamatory, offensive, profane, or entirely unrelated to the purpose of the Site or the Services;</br></br>3.     that is intended to obtain password, account, or Personal Information (as defined in Section XI, “Privacy Policy,” below) from any other User;</br></br>4.     that violates the legal rights (such as the right to privacy) of others; or</br></br>5.     that infringes the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary right of any User or other party.</br></br>Each of the preceding is provided as an example of, and not as a limitation on, prohibited conduct.</br></br>You agree that, with the exception of accessing RSS feeds and other features provided by Volt allowing automated access to the Site or its Services, you will not use any other automated means to access the Site or any of the Services for any purpose without express written permission having been previously provided to you by Volt.</br></br>You further agree not to advertise to, or solicit, any User to buy or sell any products or services, except as permitted by Volt. You are prohibited from using any information obtained from the Site or the Services in order to contact, advertise to, solicit, or sell to any User without the express written consent of such User having exclusively first been obtained by means of a Submitted Request. (See Section IV, “Requests for Information and Services,” above.)</br></br>You further agree that you shall not:</br></br>i.          use the Site or any service on behalf of, at the request of, or pursuant to the instruction of, any third party, or</br></br>ii.         sell or transfer your profile or user id to another.</br>Volt reserves the right, to be exercised in its sole discretion, to remove any Content, or deactivate any Volt.com User registration, at any time, for any reason, including but not limited to the receipt of reports or claims from third parties, or legal or regulatory authorities, relating to such Content or User, or for no reason at all. To report violations of these TOU, please email abuses@Volt.com.</br></br>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users of the Site and the Services, Channel Partners, and Third-Party Vendors. Volt reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users that are the subject of Content posted by you or such other User at the Site, or materials provided or disseminated by either of you as part of the Services.</br>XI. Privacy Policy</br></br>See Volt’s Privacy Policy to learn about the types of information we may collect from you (including information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to uniquely identify or contact a person, “Personal Information”), how we may use that information, how we store it and the steps we take to protect it, the circumstances under which we may disclose or transfer it, and the choices you have regarding submitting and maintaining the information you provide to us. We urge you to read the Privacy Policy and to become familiar with our privacy practices. The most current version of the Privacy Policy can be reviewed by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link located at the bottom of each page on the Site.</br> </br></br>XII. Copyright, Trademark and Service Mark Notices</br></br>Nothing on the Site or included in the Services should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any service mark or trademark (individually and collectively, "Mark" or "Marks") displayed on the Site or as part of the Services, without the prior written permission of Volt or the applicable Mark holder specific for each such use. The Marks may not be used to disparage Volt, the other professionals, the applicable third party, or the products or services of such parties, nor shall they be used in any manner that may damage any goodwill in the Marks. Use of any Mark as part of a link to or from any site is prohibited, unless Volt provides written approval for the establishment of such a link in advance.</br></br>The Site and the Services contain copyrighted material, trademarks and other proprietary information, including, but not limited to, text, software, photos, video, graphics, music and sound, and the entire contents of the Site and the Services are copyrighted as a collective work under the United States copyright laws. Volt owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement and enhancement of such content, as well as in the content original to it. You may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale, create derivative works or in any way exploit, any of the content, in whole or in part. Except as otherwise expressly permitted under copyright law, no copying, redistribution, retransmission, publication or commercial or non-commercial exploitation of downloaded material will be permitted without the express written permission of Volt and the copyright owner. Elements of the Site and the Services are protected by trade dress, trademark, unfair competition, and other state and federal laws and may not be copied or imitated in whole or in part, by any means, including but not limited to, the use of framing or mirrors. In addition, certain resources of the Site and the Services may also be subject to patents that are currently pending, or that have previously been granted.</br></br>XIII. Disclaimers and Liability</br></br>Volt intends that the information contained in the Site and the Services be accurate and reliable; however, errors do sometimes occur. In addition, Volt may make changes and improvements to the information provided herein at any time. Under no circumstances will Volt be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on information obtained through the Site or the Services. It is your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information, opinion, advice or other content available through the Site or the Services.</br></br>The Site and the services, and the information, software, products and services associated with them are provided "as is." Volt and/or its suppliers, providers, energy research professionals, or other professionals, disclaim any warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, as to any matter whatsoever relating to the Site and the services, and any information, software, products and services provided therein, including without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and noninfringement. Your use of the Site and/or the services is at your own risk. Even if Volt and/or its suppliers, energy research professionals, providers or other professionals have been advised of the possibility of damages, neither Volt nor its suppliers, providers, energy research professionals, or other professionals shall be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special or consequential damages or other injury arising out of or in any way connected with:</br></br>i.          the use or the inability to use the Site and/or the services, or any delays in operation or transmission, or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting from acts of god, communications failure, theft, destruction or unauthorized access to Volt’s records, programs or services;</br></br>ii.         any information, software, products and services obtained through the Site or the services, including but not limited to reliance by you on any information obtained at the Site or the services, or that result from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of files or emails, errors, or defects;</br></br>iii.         viruses, worms, trojan horses, trap doors, or other code or computer programming routines that contain contaminating or destructive properties, or that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data or personal information; or that</br></br>iv.          otherwise arise out of the use of the Site or the services, whether resulting in whole or in part from breach of contract, tortious behavior, or negligence. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.</br>XIV. Indemnity</br></br>As a condition for using the Site and/or the Services, you agree to indemnify Volt and its Third-Party Vendors from and against any and all liabilities, expenses (including attorneys\' fees) and damages arising out of claims resulting from your use of the Site and/or the Services including without limitation any claims alleging facts that if true would constitute a breach by you of this Agreement.</br>XV. Errors and Delays</br></br>Volt is not responsible for any errors or delays in responding to a request or referral form caused by, including but not limited to, an incorrect email address provided by you or other technical problems beyond our reasonable control, or for any errors or delays in responding to a request or referral form submitted to any third-party, including Third-Party Vendors.</br>XVI. Dispute Resolution</br></br>Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the use of the Site or the Services, to any goods or services provided by Volt, or to any acts or omissions for which you may contend Volt is liable, including but not limited to any claim or controversy as to arbitrability ("Dispute"), shall be finally, and exclusively, settled by arbitration. The arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator under the commercial arbitration rules of the Florida, Unites States. To begin the arbitration process, a party must make a written demand therefor.</br></br>Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrators shall not have the power to award damages in connection with any Dispute in excess of actual compensatory damages and shall not multiply actual damages or award consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, and each party irrevocably waives any claim thereto, except in Maine where state law will control all rights and remedies in the arbitration. The agreement to arbitrate shall not be construed as an agreement to the joinder or consolidation of an arbitration under this agreement with an arbitration of disputes or claims of any non-party, regardless of the nature of the issues or disputes involved. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.</br></br>This agreement provides that all disputes between you and Volt will be resolved by binding arbitration. You thus give up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights. You also give up your right to participate in or bring class actions. Your rights will be determined by neutral arbitrators and not a judge or jury.</br>You are entitled to a fair hearing, and the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court. Arbitrator decisions are enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court. By using the Site and Volt\'s facilities and the Services, you consent to these restrictions.</br></br>Should a Dispute arise and should the arbitration provisions herein become inapplicable or unenforceable, or in any instance of any lawsuit between you and Volt, the parties agree that jurisdiction over and venue of any suit shall be exclusively in the state and federal courts sitting in and for Miami, Florida, United States. If either party employs attorneys to enforce any right in connection with any Dispute or lawsuit, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\' fees.</br> </br>XVII. Other Terms</br></br>This Agreement (which hereby incorporates by reference any other provisions applicable to use of the Site and the Services, including, but not limited to, any supplemental terms governing the use of certain specific material contained in the Site and the Services and any operating rules for the Site or the Services established by Volt), constitutes the entire agreement between you and Volt and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, promises and proposals, whether oral, written or electronic, between you and Volt with respect to the Site and the Services, and the information, software, products and services associated with either of them. This Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of laws principles. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.</br></br><b>PLEASE PRINT A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR YOUR RECORDS.</br> </br>-</br> </br>BY ACCEPTING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU AUTHORIZE SUNNOVA, VOLT SOLAR ENERGY AND/OR ITS DEALERS TO CALL AND/OR TEXT YOU ABOUT ITS PRODUCTS AT THE NUMBER I ENTER ON THE VOLT SOLAR ENERGY WEBSITE.
